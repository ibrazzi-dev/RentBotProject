# ðŸ¤– Responsible AI â€“ RentBot

We are committed to **responsible and ethical AI** development.  

### **1. Fairness**
- Our dataset is a **balanced sample of Kigali districts**.
- No sensitive personal data is used.
- Predictions are **estimates** and **not absolute values**.

### **2. Transparency**
- All model code is open-source in this repository.
- A clear explanation of features and data is provided in the README.

### **3. Privacy**
- We **do not collect user data**.
- The app only processes input values for predictions in memory.

### **4. Reliability**
- The model is lightweight but **can be improved with more data**.
- Future versions will include confidence intervals and better metrics.

**Note:** This project is a **hackathon prototype** intended for demonstration only. Real-world deployment would require:
- Larger datasets
- Continuous model monitoring
- Stakeholder feedback to avoid bias
